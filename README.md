#Evolution of a mouse

The mouse is arguably the key component that led to us adopting computers widely.
Before the mouse, computers were restricted to geeks who loved the commandline. If people wanted to use a computer, they had to resort to the commandline (That green fluorescent letters on a black screen).
The creation of the mouse made the GUI (Graphical User Interface) a reality and helped the information revolution and helped the world embrace computers

##Prologue
###The first tracking ball -1952
What you see below is not really a mouse but this is what laid the ground work and made the mouse possible.

![The first Tracking ball](http://s7.computerhistory.org/is/image/CHM/500004669-03-01?$re-zoomed$)


It was invented by Tom Cranston and Fred Longstaff for the Canadian Navy. It was extremely bulky and not usable.

##The Computer Mouse: Patient Zero - 1963

It took more than 10 years after the first tracking ball for the first prototype mouse to come out.

It was invented by Douglas Engelbert while designing the precursors to what became the GUI.

![engelbert with the mouse](http://cdn.gajitz.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/douglas-engelbart-worlds-first-mouse.jpg)

Engelbert and his team christened it as the *mouse* as the early models had a cord attached to the rear part of the device looking like a tail and generally resembling the common mouse.

Despite significant size reductions, the mouse was still bulky and used two wheels perpendicular to each other: the rotation of each wheel translated into motion along one axis.

#The Xerox Alto Mouse - 1973

Building upon Engelberts work on the GUI, the Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) built the Xerox Alto, one f the first personal computers. It is reportedly the first mouse driven GUI computer.

It featured a three button mouse and utilised a steel ball.

The Alto I mouse registers movement by its large steel ball at its cord end. The ball's relative position determines the placement of the cursor on the computer screen. 

It came with different connectors to adapt to different computers.

##Apple’s Small Wonder - 1983

Apple’s wonder Stevies, Jobs & Woz, had a knack for noting other folks’ good ideas and making them better. The mouse was a case in point. The Apple Lisa of 1983 came with a beautiful mouse. 

Though developed by Apple, it was designed by an outside firm, Hovey-Kelly (Renamed IDEO), who built hundreds of prototypes and conducted exhaustive testing with focus groups in order to create the perfect device. Their perseverance paid off as not only did they bring the design in on time and on budget, but the resulting device remained virtually unchanged for almost 20 years.

It was this mouse that established Apple's mouse as a one-button device for over 20 years. Every single aspect of the mouse was researched and developed, from how many buttons to include, to how loud the click should be. The original case design was Bill Dresselhaus's and took on an almost Art Deco flavor with its formal curving lines to coordinate with the Lisa.

The Macintosh mouse (shown above) was little changed from the original Lisa version and is completely interchangeable. The case was a slightly darker brown than Lisa's beige coloring and it had less formal lines, with a thick chamfer around its edges to match the Macintosh case.


##Microsoft Makes a Mouse - 1983

Microsoft one-upped the Apple Lisa by bringing the version of the IBM PC mouse to market in 1983. It featured two buttons – that’s the “one-upped” part – and retailed for $195 each. The price sounds shocking today but compared to the $400 three-button [Hawley X063X](https://s3.amazonaws.com/picollecta-pics-large/M1/PIC1001976217/AYFZCFTCBW.JPG) from the Mouse House it seemed quite reasonable.

##The Hockey Puck - 1998

![](http://img.weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mouse_4.jpg)

Apple would stick with squarish, boxy styling for some time… too long, some say, before overshooting the mark in 1998 with the Apple USB Mouse, product number M4848. 

Designed more to match the sensuous curves of the groundbreaking iMac then to address any ergonomic concerns, the so-called “hockey puck” may not have cramped anyone’s style – but their hands were another matter.

##Logitech Flies Without Wires - 1991

![](http://img.weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mouse_6.jpg)

By the late 1980s, Logitech had emerged as the leading “alternative” peripherals provider. After first releasing a 3-button mouse in 1982, Logitech introduced the MouseMan Left, MouseMan Right and MouseMan Large in 1990. It then released the first wireless mouse, Logitech’s Cordless MouseMan, the very next year. As the first mouse without a tail, so to speak, the Cordless MouseMan used RF (radio frequency) technology which didn’t require line-of-sight alignment and was powered by a quartet of Ni-Cad batteries.

##Introducing the *Wheel* - 1995

![](http://img.weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mouse_7.jpg)

1995 brought us **ProAgio**, the first mouse with a built-in **scroll wheel**… or rather, Mouse Systems did. The Fremont, CA based company was ahead of its time but behind the 8-ball when it came to advertising. Here’s what Mouse Systems had to say about their great leap forward: “Surfing the Net has never been easier – with ProAgio ($49.99), the incredible five-button PC mouse. ProAgio is the latest wave in Web technology, with a scrolling roller that lets you zoom through Web pages without ever touching the scrollbar. So, why crawl when you can cruise the Web with ProAgio’s unparalleled speed, performance, and flexibility?”

##Its the wheel thing - 1996

![](http://img.weburbanist.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mouse_8.jpg)

Mouse Systems made a good case for the scroll wheel but it wasn’t until Microsoft jumped on the bandwagon that things really began to scroll. In 1996, the first Microsoft Intellimouse was released featuring a third mouse button under the wheel. 

This made the scroll wheel popular and made it mainstream.

##The Light at the End of the Mousehole - 1999

In 1999, Microsoft released the Intellimouse Explorer, and the Intellimouse with IntelliEye. Both were optical mice, and though they once again were not the first optical mice available, they were the two models that won peoples hearts. 

In 2004, Logitech MX-1000 (below) introduced the first optical mouse with Laser baser tracking which made the mouse experience a lot smoother.

##Its Playtime - 1998

![](http://www.maximumpc.com/files/imagecache/futureus_imagegallery_fullsize/gallery/boomslang.jpg)

It’s hard to remember now, but mice weren’t always split into casual and gaming varieties. The Boomslang—Razer’s first product—was one of the first to make the distinction, with giant buttons and a design unlike anything we’d seen before.

Razer continues to innovate in the gmaing space many modern and 0-lag mouses.

##Its Like Magic - 2009

![](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Magic_Mouse.jpg)

Not content with its previous efforts to de-buttonify the mouse, Apple released the **Magic Mouse** in 2009, with a minimalist design and a multi-touch pad covering the whole surface of the mouse.
